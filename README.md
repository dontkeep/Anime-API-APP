# Anime-API-App
this app can search any anime and gives out information about the selected anime. It will only show the anime that's available on the API : 
```bash
https://api.jikan.moe/v4/
```

endpoint used to search for an anime: 
```bash
anime
```

endpoint used to get a specific anime detail :
```bash
anime/{id}/full
```

feel free to use this project as a reference to make your own app that uses the same API!
